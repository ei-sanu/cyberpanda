## 📚 About The Project

This interactive web platform educates developers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and students about common web vulnerabilities through hands-on simulations and visualizations. Learn about critical security concepts in a safe, engaging environment without exploiting actual vulnerabilities.

### 🛡️ Featured Security Topics:

- **SQL Injection**: Understand how attackers can manipulate database queries
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Learn about reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS attacks
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Explore how attackers can trick users into performing unwanted actions

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Simulations**: Try SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks in safe, simulated environments
- **Animated Visualizations**: Understand attack vectors through animated diagrams
- **Code Examples**: Compare vulnerable and secure code implementations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **3D Security Visualizations**: Engaging 3D elements using Spline
